# Blackjack-Python
I developed a Blackjack card game in Python, demonstrating a strong grasp of logic calculations. Utilizing the popular 'Blackjack' card game as the foundation, I created a functional and interactive program.
I designed the game to deal cards to both the player and the computer, implementing the necessary logic for scoring and decision-making during gameplay. The project required creating functions for dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining the winner based on specific game rules.
Utilizing the Python programming language, I utilized the 'random' module to generate random cards for both the player and the computer. I created a scoring system that accounted for the special value of the Ace card, allowing it to be worth either 1 or 11 points based on the player's hand. Additionally, I implemented user prompts, allowing players to choose whether to draw another card ('y') or pass ('n').
The final program provides an engaging and interactive Blackjack experience for users. It features clear prompts and feedback, ensuring a user-friendly interface. The game accurately calculates scores, handles special card values, and determines the winner based on established Blackjack rules. - enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž https://replit.com/@AnthonyX3/blackjack-Python?v=1
